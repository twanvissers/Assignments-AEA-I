    "Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. We call these applications cryptocurrencies. Some are extremely valuable nowadays, take for example [Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoin.com/). Meanwhile others may in potential become at least as valuable as Bitcoin is.\n",
